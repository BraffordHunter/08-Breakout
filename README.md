BOO! Did I scare you? This a halloween themed version of the block game called breakout. There is a spider paddle and a ghost ball. There are angry pumpkin blocks that are in a layered format. As well as a haunted house background. There is a score keeping system and you have three lives in each game. You lose one life each time you don't catch the ball and save it before it falls off. Can you score the most points or break all the blocks before all three lives are up?
